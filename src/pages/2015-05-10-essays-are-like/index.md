Essays are like Platypuses – they’re a strange combination of (seemingly) incongruous elements. Essays are objective arguments fueled by deep, subjective opinion. Essays are polite and formal, while at the same time being aggressive arguments.

Study the ~~Platypus~~ essay, get to know its quirks and its unique elements, learn to work with it (just watch out for the venomous fang on the hind leg).
