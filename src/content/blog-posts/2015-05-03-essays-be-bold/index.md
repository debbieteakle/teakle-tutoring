Hey there students of English!

I’ve been thinking about essay writing lately and I’ve got some ideas I want to share.

I think essay writing should be ‘bold’ and the thesis statement should reflect this. Every good essay starts with a sharp, punchy thesis statement. A bold thesis statement can be defined simply as a clear statement of position (‘thesis’ means position) in response to the question. Essay questions are not there to be re-stated! Essay questions are meant to *provoke* a response – you’re meant to *react* to an essay question. A student who is provoked into a response will tend to write a bold thesis statement that immediately creates two things worth thinking about:

* Firstly, she or he has conveyed unashamed commitment to an argument – writing a bold thesis means you simply have to back it up now don’t you?
* Secondly, a bold thesis statement raises expectations in the reader (marker!) and if you *meet* those raised expectations you can expect good things will come of it. How do you meet these raised expectations? Easy – you provide good examples from the text to support your wonderful insights and ideas.

Students who respond to a question by re-wording or re-stating it might as well write: “Hello, I don’t actually have an opinion about this and that’s probably because I have not spent enough time with the texts in question. Perhaps I did spend too much time doing other things and it has caught up with me.”

That is not a good way to start an essay! A bold thesis statement is.
