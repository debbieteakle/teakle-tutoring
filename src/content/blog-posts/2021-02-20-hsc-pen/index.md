It’s important to choose a *writing instrument* - not a cheap plastic pen. Make sure the ink is black, that it’s comfortable to use. So go out and find your perfect writing instrument, then buy at least ten to last the year. Cheap pens are made for signing documents, shopping lists and post-it notes. They’re not essay worthy.

(Oh, and please don’t weigh your pen down with batteries, that trick never works.)
