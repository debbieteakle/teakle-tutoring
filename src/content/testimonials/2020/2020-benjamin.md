Mat was my English tutor for year 12. I began tutoring just before the trial exams, and in the 
time between the trials and the hsc I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to interpret 
stimulus myself. Matâ€™s tutoring sessions are very well planned and allowed me to focus on specific 
areas I needed to improve on. I would 100% recommend Mat as an English tutor, as he helped me a 
lot to achieve the best I could for the hsc English exams.
