Mat is an incredible English tutor and has been supporting me in my learning for 5 years and 
most of my high school period. He genuinely loves English and teaching his students, and that 
comes across so clearly in our weekly lessons. Every lesson we had was different and exciting 
with new content, skills or practice exercises and unseen texts. Mat helped me greatly improve 
my essay writing which was so helpful when I studied the International Baccalaureate (IB). 
I would especially like to acknowledge and appreciate his willingness to explore a completely 
different course, the IB, despite his focus on HSC in his other students. Mat always ensured 
that he knew my texts well, even with some very obscure novels, and continually challenged me 
to develop new and fresh readings of the texts. He also supplemented my own ideas with unique 
thoughts of his own, which never ceased to provoke interesting conversations about different 
perspectives on the texts. I cannot recommend Mat enough, not only in his skill and expertise 
in English, but also for his friendly and laid-back character. I strongly believe that all 
students would greatly benefit from Mat's teaching. With Mat's incredible guidance and advice, 
I am proud to say that I have achieved the highest grade in English Higher Level for my final 
exams, and placed first in my cohort in the subject. Thank you so much Mat!
