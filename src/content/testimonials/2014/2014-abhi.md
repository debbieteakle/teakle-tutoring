Hi Mat, it’s Abhi. I just wanted to let you know that I got a 92 for English! I also got a 98.55 atar, which I’m so over the moon about. 
Anyway, thank you so much for all the help, advice and guidance that you’ve given me over the last few months. As well as all the essays you’ve marked, emails and discussions! 
I couldn’t have done it without all of those things.
