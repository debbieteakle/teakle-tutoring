Mat is a great teacher, and always gave me exceptionally clear and direct guidance in my
English work. He explains things in a straightfoward manner, and helped me rationalise
and make sense of several texts and the relevant concepts within them, as well as developing
clarity in my own writing. I thank him for all his work and cannot recommend him enough!
