Joining online tutoring with Mat in my final year of school was one of the best decisions I made in Year 12. 
Originally, I was a little apprehensive joining online tutoring through Skype, however the flexibility and comfort of tutoring in your own home (especially in my pyjamas) proved to be 
more beneficial than any other tutorials I had and thanks to him, I scored myself a Band 5 in English Advanced. Matâ€™s passion and love for English is contagious and my attitude towards literature 
completely changed because of him. Definitely recommend!
