Hi Mat! First of all I'd like to thank myself for choosing you as my English tutor for three years. My decision was an excellent one and without it, 
I would have chosen a lesser tutor. I'd also like to thank my parents for having me in the first place so I could grow up to choose a great tutor and get a band 6 for English Advanced.
I'm now studying Economics and my confidence in writing and speaking is indeed a valuable asset! 
Oh and I should also say thanks to Mat!
