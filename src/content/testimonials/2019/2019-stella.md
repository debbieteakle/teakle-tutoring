Mat was my tutor for years 11 and 12 and it was one of the best decisions I made. He helped improve my English skills so much. 
His wealth of knowledge made me really appreciate the nature of this subject. 
I ended up with a Band 5 overall and English was my top mark which I couldnâ€™t be happier about. I definitely recommend Mat to anyone who needs an extra boost with their English!
