Learning English from you has both boosted my confidence and my understanding of English. 
Before, I was unsure of what I was doing or how to make sense of the new English syllabus, but after I learnt from you, I had a whole different perspective on
how to attack texts and create more cohesive essays. You later gave me tools to analyse not only text for exams, but how these can be applied to the real world 
and the implications it has. And for that I am very thankful.
