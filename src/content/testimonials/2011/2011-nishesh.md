Mat was a phenomenal tutor who helped me during my HSC in 2011. He has a wealth of knowledge and genuinely cares about the students he teaches. 
The passion, energy, and insights he brought to each lesson has shaped the way I write and think about English as a subject and language. Even whilst studying engineering at university, 
I have found that his lessons have continued to benefit me throughout the years. I would highly recommend him to any student who wishes to write well for the HSC and beyond.
