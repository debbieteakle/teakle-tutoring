He genuinely loves English and teaching his students, and that\ncomes across so clearly in our weekly lessons. Every lesson we had was different and exciting\nwith new content, skills or practice exercises and unseen texts. Mat helped me greatly improve\nmy essay writing which was so helpful when I studied the International Baccalaureate (IB).\nI would especially like to acknowledge and appreciate his willingness to explore a completely\ndifferent course, the IB, despite his focus on HSC in his other students. Mat always ensured\nthat he knew my texts well, even with some very obscure novels, and continually challenged me\nto develop new and fresh readings of the texts. He also supplemented my own ideas with unique\nthoughts of his own, which never ceased to provoke interesting conversations about different\nperspectives on the texts. I cannot recommend Mat enough, not only in his skill and expertise\nin English, but also for his friendly and laid-back character. I strongly believe that all\nstudents would greatly benefit from Mat's teaching. With Mat's incredible guidance and advice,\nI am proud to say that I have achieved the highest grade in English Higher Level for my final\nexams, and placed first in my cohort in the subject. Thank you so much Mat!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"studytype":"HSC","year":"2020","author":"Benjamin R","location":"Sydney","path":"/2020-benjamin"},"id":"d9ebbe30-7351-5d32-8b6a-bb6813e9547a","html":"<p>Mat was my English tutor for year 12.

You later gave me tools to analyse not only text for exams, but how these can be applied to the real world\nand the implications it has.

First of all I'd like to thank myself for choosing you as my English tutor for three years. My decision was an excellent one and without it,\nI would have chosen a lesser tutor.
