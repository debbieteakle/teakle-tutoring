Every good essay starts with a sharp, punchy thesis statement. A bold thesis statement can be defined simply as a clear statement of position (‘thesis’ means position) in response to the question. Essay questions are not there to be re-stated! Essay questions are meant to <em>provoke</em> a response – you’re meant to <em>react</em> to an essay question. A student who is provoked into a response will tend to write a bold thesis statement that immediately creates two things worth thinking about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, she or he has conveyed unashamed commitment to an argument – writing a bold thesis means you simply have to back it up now don’t you?</li>\n<li>Secondly, a bold thesis statement raises expectations in the reader (marker!) and if you <em>meet</em> those raised expectations you can expect good things will come of it. How do you meet these raised expectations? Easy – you provide good examples from the text to support your wonderful insights and ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students who respond to a question by re-wording or re-stating it might as well write: “Hello, I don’t actually have an opinion about this and that’s probably because I have not spent enough time with the texts in question. Perhaps I did spend too much time doing other things and it has caught up with me.”</p>\n<p>That is not a good way to start an essay! A bold thesis statement is.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/essays-be-bold","title":"Essays – It Pays to be Bold","author":"Mathew Teakle","date":"03 May, 2015","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/f5ad6/be-bold.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/740c5/be-bold.jpg 235w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/1a7ba/be-bold.jpg 470w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/f5ad6/be-bold.jpg 940w,\n/static/3036b012eef005d951e4790b2ba24a86/10d63/be-bold.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"}}},"featuredImage_alt":"rock climber"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a2b7d8a2-6d1e-597c-a030-18191af7e7e1"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
