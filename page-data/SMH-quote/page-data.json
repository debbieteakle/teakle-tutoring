I don’t get ‘inundated’ with requests like this – the journo is a nice chap – but they’re <em>his</em> words not mine. I told him I’d had requests, but always refuse. I also told him that I teach to prepare students for life beyond the HSC. The main reason I refuse to write essays is that it is simply, clearly, categorically <em>unethical</em>. The second is that to me, the HSC is like a trusty old Holden Statesman ute that’s held together by wire and duct tape and has one of those map of Australia radio antennas – it might be a little outdated and messy, but it works wonderfully. Somehow, year after year, the good ol’ HSC gets the job done.</p>\n<p>Also, did you notice that the part of this article that features my ‘contribution’ has a rather deliciously ironic grammatical problem!?</p>\n<p>Seriously though, I’m waaaaaaaay against this approach to the HSC English courses. You just need to do your best, get some help if you need it – but just do your best.</p>\n<p>What else is there?</p>\n<p>Please don’t buy essays or use other people’s work. It will only come back to haunt you later in life. Cast your mind into the future for a moment and imagine you’ve been asked to give a presentation to the boss. Now imagine you cheated in the HSC by purchasing pre-prepared essays and then regurgitated them verbatim.</p>\n<p>This is your boss’ response to your presentation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrWoG8IckyE\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrWoG8IckyE</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/SMH-quote","title":"In the news","author":"Mathew Teakle","date":"07 June, 2015","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEAwX/xAAXAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQID/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHfyugxqJzsLjzBlt//xAAbEAACAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADEhEiMf/aAAgBAQABBQJ0FkFCLCvJWDiPnVbtxvQ+n//EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBL/2gAIAQMBAT8BZqH/xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAR/9oACAECAQE/AW1L/8QAHRAAAQMFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEQIhQVFhof/aAAgBAQAGPwK/hkhBHo6yzs//xAAbEAEAAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMXFRof/aAAgBAQABPyEGmnqXAYd7CdmGdg+319miQWN/sMl3wwdcTRIdpaRP/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCYJzz/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEh/9oACAEDAQE/EORiIGF//8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPxAnKe3/xAAcEAEBAAMBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUFRYXH/2gAIAQEAAT8Qdxyahf7kP0KN9pHzK3c1F7gpUJudq+fkyhCVYCmIBd28R+YpNVBNdzolHpDlpQFb4MM//9k=","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/f5ad6/newspaper.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/740c5/newspaper.jpg 235w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/1a7ba/newspaper.jpg 470w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/f5ad6/newspaper.jpg 940w,\n/static/3cb29f695117cbe94cc48db02bd5555b/10d63/newspaper.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"}}},"featuredImage_alt":"person reading newspaper"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
